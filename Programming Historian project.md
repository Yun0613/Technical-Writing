1. What is the purpose (or even the mission) of the Programming Historian project?
The purpose of the Programming Historian project is publishing novice-friendly, peer reviewed tutorials that help humanists learn a wide range of digital tools, techniques, and workflows to facilitate research and teaching. 

2. Who is the audience for the project?
The Programming Historian speaks to a variety of audiences and reader skill levels. Some lessons are for complete beginners, others are for those considerably more comfortable with technical concepts and methods, and yet others are directed toward experienced digital historians looking to solve difficult technical challenges.

3. Would you consider The Programming Historian a work of technical writing/communication? Why? Or, if not, why not?
 I do consider The Programming Historian is a work of technical writing/communication. Because the peer reviewed tutorials can comment through GitHub, the original writer can receive the feedback immediately. And the original writer can keep fix the writing.
