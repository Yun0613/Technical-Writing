5. A short description of the situation/need that your lesson responds to (consider details of purpose, audience, context):

This tutorial responds to a couple of scenarios. Student can place assignments and class materials into notability, they can record lectures, and make notes with the class documents. They can also search online for relative informations about that topic and copy the informations they searched to their class documents or insert pictures.
